    <h1>Sewing Guide</h1>
    <p><i>In this sewing guide, the process has been divided into two separate sections: first, sewing the block pads, and second,
      sewing the sensor pads. However, each of these sections have the same three parts: 1) cutting and marking, 2) sewing velcro,
      and 3) adding electronics. Therefore, it is possible to build both the block pads and the sensor pads at once, if you’d prefer
       to condense the steps. Parts 1 and 2 (cutting and sewing) are very similar for both pads. </i></p>

    <h2>Block Pads, Part 1: Cut and Mark</h2>
    <p>The felt will be cut much larger than necessary because it is essential that the felt is not too small. The overall size of
      the diagrams represents the whole felt pad, even though most of this is excess. </p>
    <ol>
      <img id="block-pad-velcro-dimensions" src="static/Block Pad and Velcro Dimensions.png" alt="Picture of felt and Velcro sections with measurements">
      <li>Cut a 9” x 12” sheet of grey felt into 6 rectangles (each 4” x 4.5”)</li>
      <li>Cut loop velcro (soft side) into ⅜” strips (12 total)</li>
      <li>Based on the diagram below, use chalk to mark the edges of the final felt square and the edges of the velcro placement.
        These marks will only be made on the front side, leaving the back blank.</li>

      <img id="chalked-block-pads" src="static/Chalked Block Pads.png" alt="Image of the felt marked with chalk to denote placement and sew lines">
      <li>Repeat with all 6 grey felt swatches.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Block Pads, Part 2: Sew Velcro</h2>
    <img id="block-pad-velcroed" src="static/Block Pad with Velcro.png" alt="Image of a felt swatch with conductive Velcro sewn on">
    <ol>
      <li>Following the chalk markings that were made in the previous step, sew the loop velcro into the grey felt. Sew along all
        four edges of the velcro for a secure connection (see diagram below for stitch locations). This will be easiest and fastest
         with a sewing machine, yet hand sewing is also an option.</li>
      <img id="velcro-sewing-diagram" src="static/Velcro Sewing Diagram.png" alt="Diagram of Velcro placement on the felt swatch">
      <li>Repeat with all six grey felt swatches.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Block Pads, Part 3: Add electronics</h2>
    <p>In this step, the resistors need to be curled so that the wires form a secure loop on each end. This allows them to be sewn
       into the felt. </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Using needle nose pliers, curl the ends of each resistor. The overall length doesn’t need to be too precise; anywhere close
         to ¾” is fine. See the video below for an example of what this process will look like.</li>
         <video  height="240" width="320" autoplay>
           <source src="resistorcurling.mp4" type="video/mp4">
         </video>
      <img id="curled-resistor" src="static/Curled Resistor.png" alt="image of a resistor with its two leads curled into rings">
      <li>Next, sew the curled resistors to the back side of the block pads (the side without velcro). Unlike the velcro sewing,
        this must be done by hand. </li>
      <img id="block-pad-resistor" src="static/Block Pad with Resistor.png" alt="Image of a resistor sewn onto a felt swatch">
      <li>First, attach one end of the resistor to the felt by sewing multiple stitches around the resistor wire loop that was
        just created. </li>
      <img id="block-pad-resistor-closeup" src="static/Resistor Sewing Closeup.png" alt="Closeup of resistor loop stitched to sensor pad">
      <li>Next, once the resistor loop is securely in place, stitch up along the felt into the velcro. Sew back and forth along
        the velcro to ensure a secure connection. </li>
      <li>Using the same process, sew the second end of the resistor to the other velcro patch.</li>
      <li>Repeat with the 5 other resistors.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Sensor Pads, Part 1: Cut and Mark</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Cut 9” x 12” black felt into 4 rectangles (4.5” x 6”). Only 3 will be used, but this will produce an extra in case
        it is necessary</li>
      <li>Cut hook velcro (rough side) into ¾” strips (6 total)</li>
      <img id="sensor-pad-velcro-dimensions" src="static/Sensor Pad and Velcro Dimensions.png" alt="Diagram of a black felt swatch and conductive Velcro with measurements">
      <li>Based on the diagram below, use chalk to mark the edges of the final felt square and the edges of the velcro placement.</li>

    </ol>

    <h2>Sensor Pads, Part 2: Sew Velcro</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Following the chalk marks that were made in the previous step, sew the hook velcro into the black felt by sewing along all
        four edges of the velcro. See diagram below for a guideline of where to sew</li>
      <img id="sensor-pad-velcro-sewing" src="static/Sensor Pad Velcro Sewing Diagram.png" alt="Diagram of Velcro placement on felt swatch">
      <img id="sensor-pad-with-velcro" src="static/Sensor Pad with Velcro.png" alt="Image of a black felt swatch with Velcro attached">
      <li>Repeat with all three chalked swatches.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Sensor Pads, Part 3: Add electronics</h2>
    <p>In this step, you prepare the wiring that allows the velcro to act as a sensor and add it to the sensor felt pad.</p>
    <img id="heat-shrunk-connector" src="static/Heat Shrunk Connector.png" alt="Image of a crimped ring connector with heat shrink">
    <ol>
      <li>Cut six 9” pieces of 26g silicone wire
        <ol>
          <li>Three black or grey</li>
          <li>Three colored (make each of these different colors for easy distinction later on)</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Strip approximately ½” of each end</li>
      <li>Crimp the stripped end of the wire into the ring terminal (see <a href="crimpingGuide.html">Crimping Guide</a> for assistance)</li>
      <li>Cut a piece of X (size) heat shrink that will cover the plastic of the terminal ring (approx. ¾” to 1”). To heat shrink
         the tube, position the heat shrink so that it is entirely covering the poastic of the terminal ring, then apply heat from
          a heat gun evenly until it has sealed to the shape of the ring terminal and the wire.</li>
      <li>Repeat with all wires until all six are crimped and heat-shrinked. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>The wire is now ready to be sewn into the felt pad.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>First, take a colored wire and use conductive thread to secure the ring to the felt by sewing in a star shape around
        the entire ring.</li>
        <img id="sewn-ring-connector" src="static/Sewn Ring Connector.png" alt="ring connector with conductive thread sewing">
      <li>Next, wrap the conductive thread several times around the terminal ring (without sewing through felt) to secure the
        connection.</li>
      <img id="wrapped-ring-connector" src="static/Wrapped Ring Connector.png" alt="ring connector with extra conductive thread wrapping">
      <li>Once the terminal ring has a secure connection to the conductive thread, sew the thread across the felt to the velcro
        pad. Sew all the way across the velcro to secure the connection. </li>
      <li>Sew the next terminal ring (using a gray/black wire) to the second velcro patch facing in the same direction.</li>
      <li>Repeat with the next three felt pads so that each pad has one colored wire and one grey/black wire attached. </li>
    </ol>
