    <h1>Soldering Guide</h1>
    <p><i>CRISPEE Emu’s electronics require soldering in a few key places: the mixing indicator, the arcade button quick connects, the lantern, the mixing platform LEDs, and the force sensor. This guide describes
      the pieces of these electronics that require soldering and other special connections.</i></p>
    <h2>Mixing Indicator</h2>
    <img id="v3-highlight-mixing-strip" src="static/Emu Highlight Mixing LED Strip.png" alt="Picture of CRISPEE v3 highlighting the mixing indicator">
    <p>The LED strip on the front of CRISPEE, indicating the mixing motion, is a strip of RGBW Neopixel LEDs.</p>
    <img id="neopixel-strip" src="static/Neopixel Strip.jpg" alt="Closeup of an exposed Neopixel strip">
    <p>You can cut these strips of LEDs to whatever length you need. Be sure to cut down the center of the column of copper strips, so that one half comes away with GND, DO, and 5V labels, and the other half comes
      away with GND, DI, and 5V labels</p>
    <img id="cut-strip" src="static/Cut Neopixel Strip.jpg" alt="Closeup of a cut Neopixel strip">
    <p>We do not want to solder to the DO side of the strip, because we have no need to daisy chain Neopixels across CRISPEE. Only solder leads to the side of the car with 5V, DI, and GND labels. The DI lead should
      be plugged into a digital data pin.</p>
    <p>To solder leads to these LED strips:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Strip a very small section of a high gauge wire</li>
      <li>Apply a very small amount of tin to an individual copper contact on the strip</li>
      <li>Apply a very small amount of tin to the exposed end of the wire lead</li>
      <li>Hold the wire to the copper contact and apply heat to the tin on the wire and the contact so it melts together</li>
      <li>Ensure a solid connection, adding tin as needed</li>
      <li>Repeat for all three contacts, ensuring clean separation of contacts, leads, and solder</li>
      <li>Add heat shrink to excess exposed wire on the leads</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Modifying quick connect leads</h2>
    <p>Block checking is initiated with the press of a slightly modified 30 mm translucent clear Adafruit arcade button</p>
    <img id="v3-highlight-button" src="static/Emu Highlight Button.png" alt="Picture of CRISPEE v3 highlighting the step 1 button">
    <p>The Adafruit arcade button comes with quick connect leads. These slide onto the pins of the button mechanism and have snaps on the other ends for wires</p>
    <img id="button-snaps" src="static/Button Snaps.jpg" alt="Picture of the bottom of an arcade button">
    <p>We do want to use the button pin snaps, but we do not want to use the wire snaps. We cut the snaps off and strip the wires. One of the wires goes directly into a digital data pin. You may wish to solder a neater
      connector or wire onto the end of the data lead than to jam the stripped wire, with its many filaments and possibilities for shorting, into the pin. To do this, you would</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Strip the end of the neater wire</li>
      <li>Wrap the data lead and the neater wire together by crossing them at the halfway points of the stripped sections and twisting the sections together</li>
      <li>Hold tin on top of the knot of wires</li>
      <li>Apply heat to the bottom of the knot</li>
      <li>Ensure a solid connection between the data lead and the neater connector</li>
      <li>Cover the soldered knot with heat shrink</li>
      <li>Apply heat to the heat shrink until there is a snug covering over the soldered connection</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The button also needs to be connected to ground. We don’t have enough +5V and ground pins on the Arduino for everything in CRISPEE that needs electricity, so we connect power leads to a terminal block</p>
    <img id="terminal-block" src="static/Terminal Block.jpg" alt="Picture of an 8-width terminal block">
    <p>To connect the ground lead of the button to a power block:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Cut off the wire snap</li>
      <li>Strip a small section of the wire</li>
      <li>Crimp a ring connector onto the stripped section. See the <a href="crimpingGuide.html">Crimping Guide</a> for thorough instructions on attaching a ring connector</li>
      <li>Thread a screw through the ring connector</li>
      <li>Bolt the screw into the terminal block</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you use the LED that comes in the arcade button, you need leads to +5V and to a digital data pin. Modifying the leads to +5V and LED data follows similar rules to the ground and button data leads, respectively.</p>

    <h2>Soldering to Neopixel ring and individuals</h2>
    <img id="v3-highlight-lantern" src="static/Emu Highlight Lantern.png" alt="Picture of CRISPEE v3 highlighting the lantern">
    <p>The lantern is a ring of 7 RGBW Neopixel LEDs inside of a plastic hemisphere coated with white acrylic paint on the inside to diffuse the light, since the Neopixels are very bright. This 7 LED ring is called a Jewel.</p>
    <img id="neopixel-jewel" src="static/Glowing Neopixel Jewel.jpg" alt="Image of a Neopixel Jewel">
    <p>All Neopixel LED products follow the four pin schematic of +5V, ground, data in, and data out, with data out only being necessary for daisy chaining. Neopixel rings have the contacts for these various inputs in the
      middle of the boards. You can choose to thread wire through the contacts, or just solder on top of the front or back</p>
    <img id="jewel-front" src="static/Neopixel Jewel Front.jpg" alt="Image of the front of the Jewel's board">
    <img id="jewel-back" src="static/Neopixel Jewel Back.jpg" alt="Image of the back of the Jewel's board">
    <p>To attach leads to the back contacts of the  Jewel:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Apply a small amount of tin to the Jewel input contact on the back. Don’t hold the iron on the Jewel too long, or you’ll damage the board.</li>
      <li>Apply a small amount of tin to the stripped section on the wire</li>
      <li>Hold the wire to the Jewel contact</li>
      <li>Apply heat to the tin on the contact and the wire so they melt together</li>
      <li>Ensure a solid connection is achieved between the lead and the input contact</li>
      <li>Repeat for the ground, +5V, and data in contacts</li>
      <li>Cover the connection with electrical tape if you wish, but this is unnecessary, as there is much lower risk for shorting, and there is a small amount of electricity flowing into the Jewel</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The mixing platform LEDs are individual 8mm Neopixels. These are daisy chained, so the first two Neopixels connect their data out pin to the next Neopixel’s data in pin.</p>
    <p>You can identify the pins using the following diagram when you identify the flat side of the LED:</p>
    <img id="neopixel-diagram" src="static/Neopixel Diagram.jpg" alt="Diagram of a Neopixel LED, which has leads data in, +5V, ground, and data out from left to right if the flat portion of the Neopixel is on the right">
    <p>You can connect the leads of the individual Neopixels through the following steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Strip two ends of a short wire</li>
      <li>Identify the data out pin of an individual Neopixel. This will be the first Neopixel in the daisy chain</li>
      <li>Wrap one end of the stripped wire around the data out lead</li>
      <li>Hold tin on the top of the data out wire wrap, and apply heat to the bottom of the wire wrap until the data out lead and the wire are solidly connected</li>
      <li>Thread heat shrink up onto the data out lead as far as possible, ensuring the heat shrink covers all exposed portions of the wire and lead</li>
      <li>Thread more heat shrink onto the wire, enough to cover another connection</li>
      <li>Wrap the other end of the wire around the data in lead of the second Neopixel. This will be the second Neopixel in the daisy chain</li>
      <li>Hold tin on the top of the data-in wire wrap, and apply heat to the bottom of the wire wrap until the data-in lead and the wire are solidly connected</li>
      <li>Heat the heat shrink until both connections are covered snugly and completely</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Soldering to force sensor</h2>
    <p>The mixing process is tracked by compressions of a force sensor, similar to this one:</p>
    <img id="force-sensor" src="static/Force Sensor.jpg" alt="Image of a force sensor with a round input section">
    <p>By a one inch wheel on the bottom of the mixing platform</p>
    <img id="wheel" src="static/1 Inch Wheel.jpg" alt="Image of a 1 inch diameter wheel">
    <p>Connections are very shaky with the provided leads on the force sensor because they’re only meant to be inserted into a breadboard. Calling them leads at all instead of contacts is a
      tenuous choice in itself. So, we give the force sensor longer leads:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Strip short sections of two long wires</li>
      <li>Splay the filaments of the stripped wire</li>
      <li>Place the lead of the force sensor in the splayed filaments of the wire</li>
      <li>Twist the filaments around the force sensor lead</li>
      <li>Hold tin on top of the wire knot and apply heat to the bottom of the knot until a substantial amount of tin has melted into the knot</li>
      <li>Add tin to the knot as needed in order to solidify the connection. The lead for the force sensor is very  short, so add more extra tin than you used for other wire knots</li>
      <li>Repeat for the other force sensor lead</li>
      <li>Choose heat shrink of a very high gauge, so it fits snugly over the connection of each lead</li>
      <li>Push the heat shrink as far up the lead as possible, covering all of the connection</li>
      <li>Apply heat to the shrink until it snugly protects the connection</li>
      <li>Repeat for the other lead</li>
      <li>Choose a lower gauge heat shrink that will fit over both connections</li>
      <li>Slide this larger heat shrink over both connections and part of the lower portion of the force sensor</li>
      <li>Apply heat until the larger shrink keeps both connections solidly together, and the only movement is from the wire leads</li>
      <li>You’ll have to tape or glue down the sensor so it stays in place in the mixing platform track</li>
    </ol>
    <img id="force-sensor-placed" src="static/Force Sensor Under Platform.jpg" alt="Image of the force sensor with soldered leads taped to the internal bottom of CRISPEE">

    <h2>Creating Block Sensors</h2>
    <p>At this point you should have the platform sensor pads assembled as described in the <a href="sewingGuide.html">Sewing Guide</a>, with wires crimped into each of the ring connectors as described in the <a href="crimpingGuide.html">Crimping Guide</a>.
      The sensors work by subtracting a known resistance value from a total resistance to calculate an unknown resistance value, the value added by the resistor in the block. The circuit setup
      is shown below:</p>
    <img id="block-sensor-circuit-1" src="static/Block Sensor Circuit Diagram 1.jpg" alt="Diagram of the block sensor circuitry">
    <img id="block-sensor-circuit-2" src="static/Block Sensor Circuit DIagram 2.jpg" alt="Diagram of the block sensor circuitry">
    <p>To finish making one block sensor:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Designate one sensor pad wire as +5V and the other as data out</li>
      <li>Strip the end of the data out lead that is not crimped into the ring connector</li>
      <li>Separate the filaments of the stripped data out lead into two even groups and splay the filaments of each group, keeping them separate</li>
      <li>Strip one end of two other silicone coated wires</li>
      <li>Splay the filaments of the stripped parts of the two loose wires </li>
      <li>Put the splayed filaments of a loose lead together with one group of splayed filaments on the data out lead and twist the filament groups together</li>
      <li>Hold tin to the top of this wire knot and apply heat to the bottom of the wire knot until sufficient tin has melted into the knot to hold the connection</li>
      <li>Repeat steps 6 and 7 for the other data out filament group and loose wire</li>
      <li>Choose one of these new leads to be analog, and the other to be ground. Ground should be the shorter lead, if there is one</li>
      <li>Strip a small portion of the analog lead, twist the filaments, and leave it alone</li>
      <li>Strip a small portion of ground</li>
      <li>Splay the filaments of ground</li>
      <li>Insert one end of a 5.1 kΩ resistor into the splayed filaments of ground and twist the filaments around the resistor lead</li>
      <li>Hold tin to the top of this wire knot and apply heat to the bottom of the wire knot until sufficient tin has melted into the knot to hold the connection</li>
      <li>Strip a small portion of a new length of silicone wire and splay the filaments</li>
      <li>Insert the other end of the  5.1 kΩ resistor into the splayed filaments of the new length of wire and twist the filaments around the resistor lead</li>
      <li>Hold tin to the top of this wire knot and apply heat to the bottom of the wire knot until sufficient tin has melted into the knot to hold the connection</li>
      <li>Cut a length of heat shrink long enough to cover the resistor and soldered wire knots inserted into the ground lead</li>
      <li>Slide the heat shrink over the resistor and solderings</li>
      <li>Apply heat from a heat gun or soldering iron to the heat shrink until the connection is snugly covered</li>
    </ol>
