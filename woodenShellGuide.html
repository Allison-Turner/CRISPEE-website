    <h1>Wooden Shell Assembly Guide</h1>
    <p><i>This guide details the assembly of the wooden body of CRISPEE, excluding the platform, which is detailed in the <a href="#">Platform Building Guide</a></i></p>

    <h2>Laser Cutting</h2>
    <p>The vast majority of CRISPEE’s wooden pieces are laser cut. We used a Trotec Laser Engraver and loaded Adobe Illustrator files into the engraver job manager. We printed CRISPEE’s pieces on ¼ inch thick MDF.
      In the Illustrator files, we standardized through-cut lines to RGB (255, 0, 0) and 0.1 pt weight, and we standardized engraving lines (used only on the face plate and identifying marks) to RGB (255, 255, 255)
       and 0.1 pt weight. Through-cut lines required three passes and engraving lines required one pass by the laser. </p>

    <h2>Base External Shell</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Find the side of the external bottom that interlocks with the long rectangular front wall. This is the front of the CRISPEE, and the side of the external bottom that lies face down when the front wall is
        interlocked is the bottom face.</li>
        <li>Apply industrial glue to the bottom interlocks of the front wall</li>
        <li>Fit the bottom interlocks into the front interlocks of the external bottom</li>
        <li>Apply industrial glue to the bottom and front interlocks of both side pieces</li>
        <img src="static/External Side Wall.png" alt="Diagram of the external side, labeling the front and bottom">
        <li>Fit the interlocks of the side pieces into the interlocks of the external bottom</li>
        <li>Prop the side and front walls so that they dry perpendicularly to the external bottom</li>
        <li>Leave the assembly to dry for several hours</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Internal Walls</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Find the face of the internal bottom that allows the interlocks of all three internal walls to snap in. This is the top of the internal bottom. The side closest to the opening of the U shape of cutouts in
         the internal bottom is the front side</li>
      <li>Spread liberal amounts of glue over the bottom of the internal bottom</li>
      <li>Press the glued side of the internal bottom onto the top of the external bottom, ensuring that no part of the internal bottom overhangs the interlocks of the external bottom, and that the front side of the
        internal bottom aligns with the front side of the external bottom</li>
      <li>Apply liberal amounts of glue to the side interlocks of the internal walls</li>
      <li>Fit the internal walls together</li>
      <li>Apply liberal amounts of glue to the cutouts of the internal bottom</li>
      <li>Fit the unit of internal walls into the cutouts of the internal bottom</li>
      <li>Leave the internal wall unit to dry for several hours, checking it periodically to ensure that the interlocks are still snugly together and straight</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Closing Off the External Shell</h2>
    <p>The face and back of the external shell should be left unattached until everything else has been assembled, glued, and wired. See the <a href="sewingGuide.html">Sewing Guide</a>,
      <a href="electricalSystemGuide.html">Electronic System Assembly Guide</a>, <a href="platformGuide.html">Platform Building Guide</a>, <a href="solderingGuide.html">Soldering Guide</a>,
      <a href="blockGuide.html">Block Making Guide</a>, and <a href="crimpingGuide.html">Crimping Guide</a> for detailed instructions. When that has been done:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Dribble glue over the top interlocks of the side and front external walls and the internal walls</li>
      <li>Fit the external face over the interlocks of the front and side external walls and of the internal walls</li>
      <li>Leave the assembly to dry for several hours</li>
      <li>Cut ¼ inch wide Velcro strips for all of the interlocking sections of the back panel</li>
      <li>Apply industrial glue to each side of each Velcro unit</li>
      <li>Place one Velcro unit onto each interlocking section of the back panel</li>
      <li>Press the back panel into the interlocks of the back of the external face, sides, and bottom</li>
      <li>Let the Velcro dry to the interlocks</li>
    </ol>
