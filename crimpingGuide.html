    <h1>Crimping Guide</h1>
    <p><i>This is a guide to crimping connectors onto leads for different electronics</i></p>

    <h2>Ring Connectors</h2>
    <p>We can maintain more secure electrical connections by using ring connectors on a terminal block or to create the
      block sensors. We use these ring connectors by crimping wire leads into them. To attach ring connectors:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Strip a long section of the wire lead</li>
      <li>Twist the filaments of the lead so they are all solidly together</li>
      <li>Sit the ring connector in the crimper so that the smaller upper section of the plastic piece sits in a part of the
         crimper that is very close to its size, and so that the top part of the crimper will come down slightly to one side
         of the seam in the metal connector</li>

         </figure>
         <li>Feed the stripped portion of the lead into the metal connector on the inside of the crimper.
           <ol>
             <li>Watch the lead as you’re crimping, since it’s easy for high gauge wire to slip out of connectors even when
               they’ve been crimped down. Make sure the crimper catches the lead solidly in the crimped connector</li>
           </ol>
         </li>
         <li>Press the crimper together. You’ll have to press pretty hard</li>
         <img src="" alt="Image of the connector being compressed in the crimper">
         <li>Release the crimper</li>
         <li>Shift the connector so the top part of the crimper will come down on the other side of the seam in the metal
           connector</li>
         <li>Press the crimper together again. This time, you won’t need as much force</li>
         <li>Tug gently on the lead and the connector, testing the connection</li>
         <p>The following steps are optional. However, since heat shrinking the connector ensures a safe and solid electrical
            connection, it is strongly encouraged.</p>
         <li>Place the larger part of the plastic part of the connector in a large part of the crimper</li>
         <li>Gently compress the crimper, giving the large plastic section a sort of pleat</li>
         <li>Place the larger plastic section into a smaller part of the crimper, with the pleat facing out of the side and away
            from the joint of the crimper</li>
         <figure>
           <img src="" alt="Image of the ring connector placed in the crimper with its pleat facing away from the hinge">

         <li>Compress the larger plastic section as small as possible</li>
         <img src="" alt="Image of a fully compressed ring connector housing">
         <li>Cut a section of heat shrink to cover a small portion of the lead and the connector up to the ring</li>
         <li>Slide the heat shrink over the connector, snugly up to the ring</li>
         <img src="" alt="Image of the crimped ring connector with loose heat shrink pushed up as far as possible">
         <li>Apply heat to the heat shrink until the connector is snugly covered</li>
    </ol>
