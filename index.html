    <h1>CRISPEE: A Tangible Gene Editing Toy for Early Childhood Education</h1>

    <h2>What is CRISPEE?</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>CRISPEE is a tangible toy created by Wellesley College's Human-Computer Interaction Lab in collaboration
       with Tufts University's DevTech Lab to teach children ages five through seven about genetics and bioengineering.
       CRISPEE has gone through several design iterations, and this guide centers the latest, named Emu.
      In our introduction of bioengineering concepts to these young kids, CRISPEE was a tool used to solidify the idea of
      inhibitor and activator genes after a series of questions about life and difference. Kids place blocks in the mixing
      platform of CRISPEE, press a button to test the validity of their block combination,
       shake the mixing platform back and forth, and see a colored light display the result of their program.

    <h3>Overview of CRISPEE Construction</h3>

    <h4>External Shell</h4>
    <p>CRISPEE v3 was designed to remind the user of the asymmetry of real life gene-editing devices.</p>
    <img src="" alt ="Image of a gene sequencer">
    <img src="" alt ="Image of a gene sequencer">
    <p>It is also designed to be chunky and organic, like toys from Ikea or Melissa & Doug, hence the wood, felt, and big button.</p>
    <img src="" alt="Image of a toy wooden cash register">
    <p>The external shell houses all of the pieces of CRISPEE Emu and achieves this desired form. The external shell is made up
      of the side walls, the front wall, the removable back, the external bottom, and the face of CRISPEE.</p>
    <p>Materials:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>MDF wood</li>
      <li>E6000 industrial glue</li>
      <li>Velcro</li>
      <li>Adobe Illustrator files for lasercutting</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Equipment:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Laser engraver</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Skills:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gluing</li>
      <li>Laser cutting</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Refer to the <a href="">Wooden Shell Assembly Guide</a> for step by step instructions on creating CRISPEE’s wooden form</p>

    <h4>Internal Walls</h4>
    <p>The electronics of CRISPEE Emu are compartmentalized to the back of CRISPEE, inaccessible to young users, by the internal
      walls. The internal walls also give CRISPEE a more polished look. The internal walls form the back and sides of the space
      designated for the mixing platform, and they interlock with the internal bottom and external face of CRISPEE. The internal
      walls should be assembled before the top of the external shell is glued on.</p>
    <p>Materials:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>MDF wood</li>
      <li>E6000 industrial glue</li>
      <li>Adobe Illustrator files for lasercutting</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Equipment:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Laser engraver</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Skills:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gluing</li>
      <li>Laser cutting</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Refer to the <a href="">Wooden Shell Assembly Guide</a> for step by step instructions on creating CRISPEE’s wooden form</p>

    <h4>Platform</h4>
    <p>The platform is the central part of CRISPEE where the blocks are placed. Its form is simple: it’s just a box on wheels with
       some cutouts on the back and top. It has LEDs placed in the top face of the box and conductive Velcro pads sitting in the box.
       The idea of the platform is that a child will place a block in the platform, the conductive Velcro on the block will connect
       with the conductive Velcro on the pads in the platform, and the Arduino will be able to differentiate between blocks by running
        a current through each block connection and measuring each unique resistance level. The LEDs placed in the top of the platform
        will indicate whether the blocks placed in the platform form a valid program.</p>
    <p>Materials:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>MDF wood</li>
      <li>E6000 industrial glue</li>
      <li>4 x 1 inch diameter wheels</li>
      <li>Velcro</li>
      <li>Adobe Illustrator files for lasercutting</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Equipment</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Laser engraver</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Skills:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gluing</li>
      <li>Laser cutting</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The construction of the platform is detailed in the <a href="">Platform Building Guide</a>. The construction of the block sensors is detailed in the <a href="">Sewing Guide</a> and the <a href="">Soldering Guide</a>.</p>

    <h4>Blocks</h4>
    <p>Blocks indicate color and activation or inhibition to children with felt and height; short blocks with black Xs over the color
      are inhibitors, and tall blocks with plain patches of colored felt are activators. The blocks are differentiated by the electronic
       system by the unique resistor glued into the bottom of the block.</p>
    <p>Materials:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Red, blue, green, and black felt</li>
      <li>2 ⅜ inches wide x 1 ⅜ inches thick x 18 ¾  inches long (minimum length, adding some leeway would be better) wood beam</li>
      <li>6 resistors of unique resistance values</li>
      <li>MDF wood</li>
      <li>E6000 industrial glue</li>
      <li>Adobe Illustrator files for lasercutting</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Equipment:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Belt sander, or lots of sand paper and elbow grease</li>
      <li>Handsaw or milling machine</li>
      <li>Laser engraver</li>
      <li>Fabric scissors</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Skills:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Laser cutting</li>
      <li>Sanding</li>
      <li>Sewing</li>
      <li>Gluing</li>
      <li>Cutting wood</li>
      <li>Cutting felt</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The construction of the gene blocks is detailed in the Block Making Guide. The construction of the conductive Velcro and resistor
       assembly is detailed in the Sewing Guide.</p>
