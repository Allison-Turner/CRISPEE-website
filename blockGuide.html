    <h1>Block Making Guide</h1>
    <p><i>This is a guide on creating the gene blocks for CRISPEE Emu. Roughly, making gene blocks involves the cutting and shaping
       of the wood and the sewing and gluing of the felt and conductive sewables. Refer to the <a href="#">Sewing Guide</a> for an
       in-depth look at constructing the sewn circuits that complete the gene block and mixing platform.</i></p>

    <h2>Cutting the Blocks</h2>
    <p>Blocks come in two sizes: 3 ½  inches tall and 2 ¾  inches tall. Both are about 2 ⅜ inches wide and 1 ⅜ inches thick. These
       measurements exclude the end cap, conductive sewables, and felt.</p>
    <p>To cut the blocks:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Measure out 3 x 3 ½ inch segments and 3 x 2 ¾ inch segments on a wooden beam,  2 ⅜ inches wide and 1 ⅜ inches thick, and
         of higher quality lumber than MDF.</li>
      <li>Cut the beam completely through at each of these measurements, with any tool from a milling machine to a handsaw</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Cutting and Gluing the End Caps</h2>
    <p>We glue an end cap to the bottom of the block. The cap is ¼ inch thick MDF wood, laser cut to our specifications. We need
      this end cap to provide a space for the resistor to be, since the block wouldn’t sit flatly in the mixing platform with the
      conductive Velcro circuit glued to the flat bottom.</p>
    <p>The Illustrator file for the end cap looks like this:</p>
    <img id="end-cap" src="static/End Cap.png" alt="Simple drawing of the end cap cutout">
    <p>To cut the end caps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Ensure your through-cut lines are standardized</li>
      <li>Export the Adobe Illustrator file to your home laser cut job management software</li>
      <li>Ensure your laser engraver settings are standardized for a through-cut on MDF for the color and line weight you used
        in Illustrator</li>
      <li>Lay a sheet of ¼ inch thick MDF in your laser engraver. We used a Trotec Laser Engraver.</li>
      <li>Start the job and monitor the engraver</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You’ll want to keep the cutouts from the middle of the end caps, because these make great glue spreaders.</p>
    <p>We use industrial glue for most major joints on CRISPEE Emu, and the attachment of end caps is no exception</p>
    <img id="e6000" src="static/E6000 Industrial Glue.jpg" alt="Image of a tube of E6000 industrial glue">
    <p>To attach the end cap to the block:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Place a line of industrial glue around the hole in the middle of the end cap</li>
      <li>Use the leftover wood from cutting out the end cap from the MDF to spread the glue evenly across the cap</li>
      <li>Press the end cap onto the face of the block that will be the bottom. Make sure the cap is centered as much as possible.
         You’ll know if you’ve added enough glue if it leaks out of the sides as you press the cap on. Scrape the excess glue away.</li>
      <li>Let the block sit for several hours while the glue dries, checking that the cap is still centered</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Sanding the Blocks</h2>
    <p>At this point, the end caps may be wider than the block itself and the block is rough around the edges.</p>
    <img id="unsanded-block" src="static/Unsanded Block.png" alt="Image of the unsanded block of wood with end cap">
    <p>We’ll polish up the blocks by sanding them down. See this video for a demonstration on sanding. We use a belt sander,
      but the same result is achievable with some sand paper and some elbow grease.</p>
    <p>To sand down the blocks on a belt sander:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Hold each longer face of the block against the sander, moving the block back and forth so that the motion is parallel
         to the longer sides of the block face. This will sand down the splintery parts of the block face and remove the excess
          width of the end cap</li>
      <li>Lightly touch the sharp corners of the block to the sander to remove the worst of the angularity</li>
      <li>Roll the block from one face to the next on each corner, to thoroughly round out the shape</li>
    </ol>

    <img id="sanded-block-2" src="static/Sanded Block 2.png" alt="Image of the smoothed out block">

    <h2>Sewing the Block Side of the Circuit</h2>
    <p>CRISPEE Emu recognizes blocks because each resistor sewn into each block has a unique resistance. We have to build a
      circuit through the bottom of the gene blocks. To form a connection between the mixing platform and the gene blocks, we
      sew conductive Velcro to felt on one side, sew a resistor to the other side of the felt, and connect these components with
      conductive thread sewn into the felt. </p>
    <p>See the <a href="sewingGuide.html">Sewing Guide</a> for a step-by-step introduction to the creation of the circuits necessary to make
      blocks recognizable to CRISPEE Emu</p>

    <h2>Attaching the Circuit</h2>
    <p>After the conductive Velcro and resistor have been sewn and connected, they can be attached to the block</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Place the block so that the bare face is down, and the end cap is up</li>
      <li>Dribble a thin line of industrial glue around the hole in the middle of the end cap</li>
      <li>Use the leftover wood from cutting out the end cap to spread the glue evenly across the cap</li>
      <li>Ensure that the resistor is centered over the hole in the end cap, and the conductive Velcro pieces are over each
        end of the end cap</li>
      <li>Gently stretch the felt over the glue-covered end cap</li>
      <li>Leave it to dry for several hours</li>
      <li>Trim the felt down to the edges of the block using fabric scissors.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Indicating Activators and Inhibitors</h2>
    <p>Tall blocks are activators and short blocks are inhibitors. There is one activator and one inhibitor for each of the
      three colors: red, green, and blue. To make an activator:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Cut a 3 inch by 2 inch rectangle of felt of the desired color</li>
      <li>Place the block end cap side down</li>
      <li>Dribble industrial glue over the bare face of the block</li>
      <li>Use the spare wood from cutting the end caps to spread the glue evenly over the block face</li>
      <li>Center the section of felt over the glue-covered face of the block</li>
      <li>Gently stretch the felt over the glue-covered face of the block</li>
      <li>Leave the block standing for several hours so the glue can dry</li>
      <li>Trim the felt down to the edges of the block</li>
    </ol>
    <img id="activator-top" src="static/Activator Block Top.jpg" alt="view of a green activator block after gluing and trimming">
    <p>To make an inhibitor, follow the same steps as for an activator, but in addition:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Cut a 3 inch by 2 inch rectangle of black felt</li>
      <li>Cut the felt rectangle so it makes a big X, with each stroke of the X about half an inch wide</li>
      <li>Dribble industrial glue over the colored felt on the top face of the inhibitor block in an X shape, the strokes of
        the X going to opposite corners</li>
      <li>Spread the industrial glue with the extra MDF from the end cap so it coats the whole area that the felt X will occupy</li>
      <li>Center the X over the top face of the inhibitor block</li>
      <li>Gently stretch the felt X over the industrial glue</li>
      <li>Leave the inhibitor block to dry for several hours</li>
      <li>Trim the felt X down to the edges of the inhibitor block</li>
    </ol>
